I have some serious doubt over this solution, when s1.charAt(0) == s2.charAt(0), How can you beforehand knows that the next char at s1 is larger than of s2? Please enlighten.
​
It compares the entire string instead of only one character
​
The Time Complexity of this approach is : O(n1^2 + n2^2)
Time O(m^2+n^2)
Space O(m^2+n^2)
